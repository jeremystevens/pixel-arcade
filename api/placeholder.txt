API Placeholder Directory

This directory is reserved for the existing PHP API that handles high score submission and retrieval.

Expected API structure:
/api/
  - scores.php        (GET: retrieve scores, POST: submit new scores)
  - games.php         (GET: retrieve game information)
  - database.php      (Database connection and utilities)
  - config.php        (API configuration)

Expected API endpoints:

GET /api/scores.php?game=slug
- Returns: JSON array of high scores for specified game
- Format: [{"player_name": "name", "score": 12345, "date_achieved": "YYYY-MM-DD", "level_reached": "5"}]

POST /api/scores.php
- Accepts: JSON with game, player_name, score, level_reached
- Returns: Success/error response

GET /api/games.php
- Returns: JSON array of all available games

The main application will integrate with this API once it's added to the project.
