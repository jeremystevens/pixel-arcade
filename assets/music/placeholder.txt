This directory will contain MIDI background music files for each game:

Files needed:
- contra.mid
- pacman.mid
- galaga.mid
- donkey-kong.mid

MIDI files should be:
- Authentic chiptune/8-bit style melodies
- Looping compositions (30-60 seconds)
- Small file size for quick loading
- Compatible with standard MIDI format

The MIDI player will automatically:
- Loop the music continuously
- Provide volume control
- Show a retro-styled player interface
- Fall back to synthetic beep sounds if MIDI files are not available

You can find appropriate MIDI files from:
- Classic game soundtrack archives
- Chiptune music libraries
- Create your own using music production software

If MIDI files are not available, the player will generate synthetic retro sounds using Web Audio API oscillators.
